This is my first python project. It's a motion calculator. Today I am so happy because I did it by myself without any help from others. I fixed all of its bugs and handled all the errors. I know This is not a big achievement but this means a lot to me.
I'm not an expert but I want to be. Can anyone give me an idea of the next project?
Thank you all
